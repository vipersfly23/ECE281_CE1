Yes, Truth table matches simulation.

# Analysis
analyzing my wave form, ones and zeros are represented by steps within each line. When there's a one, the line is a step up, when there's a zero, the line steps back down. As indicated when there is not_B and A or B and C, the F is then stepped up, meaning it is turned on, or letting the signal go through. In other words, it's a 1. The wave form also provides a time interval for each case, with a total of 1000nano seconds. My wave for worked according to my expectation, and was identifcal to my truth table.
